jFlow Framework, is a model framework for node.js and in the browser. It provides a common component structure for 
maintainable and reusable code with asynchronous flow control.Some key fetures include:

*	Any number of asynchronous functions can be grouped / organised without the need for callbacks.
*	Components contain a reusable structure provided in traditional object oriented programming such as static, public and private members.
*	Extendable component structures (inheritance).
* 	Each component instance returns a unique object, i.e there is no need to use the "new" keyword.
